Welcome to the Official App for Lysack Risk (or more commonly known as just risk)

As you are probably well aware, Lysack risk is a modified risk game superior in every way to the original.
Unfortunately it has taken a long time for this game to make its departure from the minds of the Lysack children
and into the larger world. It did this first through expansion into other risk comunities including the RPMBC 
ping-pong club and the CMU boys. It received mixed reviews. However, once clearer heads prevailed the demand for Lysack 
risk grew. As the founding members of Lysack risk we, the Lysack sibling council, have taken it upon ourselves to create an 
online version Lysack risk. Although the game could not be perfectly transmitted to an online format (mostly due to 
inexperience in coding) we beleive this app captures the essense of the game. 

Any future updates to the rules will be passed through the council of siblings and be agreed upon during an official
council game session. 

I thank you for your interest in this endeavor.

To play the game download the github files from the green button in the top right of the main lysackRisk github page. Once the files are downloaded they will need to be extracted. You can do this by right clicking on the downloaded files in your file directory then clicking 'export files.' Once the files have been exported double click on the loginPage.html file and proceed from there.

trying to click directly on the loadGame, newGame, or startPage html files will not work. 

If the login page does not recognize your username it may have been deleted from both localStorage and the server (free version does not store forever). You will have to create a new account at this point and any games you were apart of will be broken.
